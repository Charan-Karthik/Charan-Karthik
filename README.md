<p align="center"> Welcome to my Github page! </p>

_**Who am I?**_ I am a software engineer with experience in full-stack development in three tech stacks (Python, Java, and Javascript/MERN).

_**I'm currently working on**_ maintaining and improving my coding skills (mainly by developing personal projects and challenging myself to try doing things a different way or learn how to implement a new feature), learning new languages (currently: Swift), and practicing data structures, design, and algorithms (on websites such as Leetcode and HackerRank).

### _What's next?_ I am seeking employment opportunities in sofware engineering so that I can apply my skills, collaborate with others, and continue learning and improving as a developer.
