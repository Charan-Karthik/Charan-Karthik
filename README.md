👨🏾‍💻 _**Who am I?**_
I am a software engineer with experience in full-stack development in three tech stacks (Python, Java, and Javascript/MERN).

🌱 _**I'm currently working on**_ 
* maintaining and improving my coding skills (mainly by developing personal projects and challenging myself to try doing things a different way or learn how to implement a new feature)
* learning new languages (currently: Swift)
* practicing data structures, design, and algorithms (on websites such as Leetcode and HackerRank).

➡️  ### _What's next?_
  I am seeking employment opportunities in sofware engineering so that I can apply my skills, collaborate with others, and continue learning and improving as a developer.
